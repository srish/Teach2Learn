Excerpts from ìThe Perfect Brainstormî
Tom Kelley with Jonathan Littman, from The Art of Innovation

ìThe best way to get a good idea is to get a Lot of ideas.î  óó LINUS PAULING

The problem with brainstorming is that everyone thinks they already do it. When I raise the topic of brainstorming in presentations conversations with business executives, I see some eyes start to glaze over with the smug "been there, done that" look of someone who already answered "yes" to the question "Do you brainstorm?" In fact, more than 70 percent of the businesspeople in a recent Arthur Andersen survey say they use brainstorming in their organizations.

Many businesspeople treat brainstorming as a check box, a threshold variable, like "Can you ride a bicycle?" or "Do you know how to tie your shoes?" They overlook the possibility that brainstorming can be a skill, an art, more like playing the piano than tying your shoes. You're always learning and can get continuously better. You can become a Brainstorming virtuoso. You can have heads of giant corporations and of government fly in to ask for your brainstorming help. (Don't laugh. I've seen it with my own eyes.)

So if you say you already do brainstorming in your organization, great, you're on your way. But I believe you can deliver more value, create more energy, and foster more innovation through better brainstorming. For one thing, you could brainstorm more often, weaving it into the cultural fabric of your organization. In that same Arthur Andersen survey of people who said they brainstorm, 76 percent admitted they brainstorm less than once a month. Less than once a month. I consider myself a movie fan, usually seeing thirty to forty films a year on the big screen (plus again as many on video), but if I dropped below one a month, I'd have to say I was a former fan. If you want to keep in shape, you have to exercise your brainstorming muscles more than once a month. So find a suitable space, order some supplies (and some chocolate chip cookies), get a good group together, and brainstorm up several dozen possible solutions to a problem that's bugging you right now. 

Brainstorming is practically a religion at IDEO, one we practice nearly every day. Though brainstorms themselves are often playful, brainstorming as a toolóas a skillóis taken quite seriously. And in a company without many rules, we have a very firm idea about what constitutes a brainstorm and how it should be organized. First, a brainstorm is not a regular meeting. It's not something you take notes at. You don't take turns speaking in any orderly way. It shouldn't consume a morning or an afternoon. Sixty minutes seems to be the optimum length, in our experience, though occasionally a brainstorm can productively stretch to an hour and a half. 

Brainstorming is the idea engine of IDEO's culture. It's an opportunity for teams to "blue sky" ideas early in a project or to solve a tricky problem that's cropped up later on. The more productive the group, the more it brainstorms regularly and effectively. We call the sessions "brainstormers," which to us sounds more like an active, engaging event. The buzz of a good brainstormer can infect a team with optimism and a sense of opportunity that can carry it through the most pressure-tinged stages of a project.
So what makes a brainstormer sing? Most people are familiar with the fundamentalsólike sticking to one conversation at a time and building on the ideas of othersóbut it takes extra effort if you want a great brainstormer with valuable results.

SEVEN SECRETS FOR BETTER BRAINSTORMING

1.  SHARPEN THE FOCUS
Good brainstormers start with a well-honed statement of the problem. This can be as simple as a question. Edgy is better than fuzzy. The session will get off to a better startóand you can bring people back into the main topic more easilyóif you have a well-articulated description of the problem at just the right level of specificity. A brainstormer without a clear problem statement is like a company without a clear strategy: You'll wander aimlessly and need a lot of extra luck or talent to succeed. If you find yourself leading a session that lacks direction, spend a few minutes developing a good problem statement. It will be time well spent. For example, "spill-proof coffee cup lids" would be a bad brainstorming topic because it's too narrow and already presumes you know the answer. Another approach, "bicycle cup holders," is too dry and product-focused. Maybe bicyclists shouldn't use cups at all, in which case they certainly don't need cup holders. A better, more open-ended topic would be "helping bike commuters to drink coffee without spilling it or burning their tongues." Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions.

We've also found that the best topic statements focus outward on a specific customer need or service enhancement rather than focusing inward on some organizational goal. For example, topics like "How can we regain market share from Company X?" or "How can we build a better search engine than Company Y?" may not lend themselves to innovations that will be embraced by the market. On the other hand, a series of more specific, customer-focused brainstorms on topics like "How can we accelerate the time-to-first-result for customers searching via dial-up modems" could uncover innovations that might yield the competitive edge you seek.

2.  PLAYFUL RULES 
Don't start to critique or debate ideas. It can sap the energy of the session pretty quickly. You need a way to turn aside critiques without turning off the critiquers completely. At IDEO many of our conference rooms have brainstorming rules stenciled in six-inch-high letters on the walls, for example, "Go for quantity," "Encourage wild ideas," or "Be visual." Not willing to mark up your walls? Perhaps the facilitator could ring a bell when participants try to turn a brainstormer into a normal meeting. Or you could print the brainstorming rules on a giant Post-it or write them prominently on a whiteboard.

3.  NUMBER YOUR IDEAS
Numbering each idea is pretty obvious, right? So obvious that it took us almost ten years to figure it out. Numbering the ideas that bubble up in a brainstorm helps in two ways. First, it's a tool to motivate the participants before and during the session ("Let's try to get a hundred ideas, before we leave the room") or to gauge the fluency of a completed brainstorm. Second, it's a great way to jump back and forth from idea to idea without losing track of where you are. We've found that a hundred ideas per hour usually indicates a good, fluid brainstorming session. One hundred and fifty per hour is pushing the speed limit. 

4.  BUILD AND JUMP
Watch for chances to "build" and "jump." High-energy brainstormers tend to follow a series of steep "power" curves, in which momentum builds slowly, then intensely, then starts to plateau. The best facilitators can nurture an emerging conversation with a light touch in the first phase and know enough to let ideas flow during the steep part of the ideation curve. It's when energy fades on a line of discussion that the facilitator really earns his or her keep.
In the coffee-while-bicycling brainstorm example above, a good "building" suggestion to keep up momentum might be: "Shock absorbers are a great idea; now, what are some other ways to reduce spillage when the bicycle hits a bump?" By contrast, when discussion tapers off, a good "jump" transition statement might be something like this: "OK, let's switch gears and consider some totally 'hands-free' solutions that allow the cyclist to keep both hands on the handlebars at all times. What might those solutions look like?"

Try building on an idea. Encourage another push or introduce a small variation. Or take a jump, either back to an earlier path you skipped by too quickly or forward to a completely new approach. Whatever you do, try to get into the next power curve and keep the energy up.

5. THE SPACE REMEMBERS
Great brainstorm leaders understand the power of spatial memory. Write the flow of ideas down in a medium visible to the whole group. There are many emerging digital technologies for group work, but we have had great success with extremely low-tech tools like Sharpie markers, giant Post-its for the walls, and rolls of old-fashioned butchershop paper on the tables. Brainstorming is an intensely group-oriented process, and the facilitator's rapid scribing is one of the focal points that hold the group together. We're not talking about taking personal meeting notes here, but capturing ideas so that the group can see their progression and return to those that seem worthy of more attention. 

Cover virtually every wall and flat surface with paper before the session starts. That way you won't find yourself in the awkward position of having to erase ideas to make room for more. And you may find there's a certain synergy in physically moving around the room writing down and sketching the ideas. As you rapidly capture the team's ideas, make a mental note of ones that are worth coming back to during a build or a jump. When you return to the spot on the wall where that idea was captured, spatial memory will help people recapture the mind-set they when the idea first emerged.

6.  STRETCH YOUR MENTAL MUSCLES
People are busy. Time is short. Is it worthwhile to "burn" some time at the beginning of a brainstorm doing some form of group warm-up? Maybe. But that "maybe" rapidly becomes a "yes" in certain circumstances:
ï When the group has not worked together before
ï When most of the group doesn't brainstorm frequently
ï When the group seems distracted by pressing but unrelated issues
One type of warm-up we practice is a fast-paced word game simply to clear the mind (Zen practitioners call it "beginner's mind") and to get the team into a more outgoing modeÖ

Another warm-up is to do some content-related homework. At IDEO we did a systematic study a few years ago to measure the value of different brainstorming warm-up techniques. We divided our pool of participants into three groups and had them brainstorm on applications of specific new technologies to the toy industry.

First we gave two of the groups homework. One group did some background reading and listened to an expert lecture on the technologies. Another group spent half an hour in a local toy store looking at the state of the art in all its variations. The third group came into the brainstorming session cold. Guess what? The group whose homework was a visit to a toy store significantly outperformed the other two, both in the quantity of ideas produced and in perceived qualityÖ.We now frequently bring "show-and-tell" to a brainstormer to help us visualize the wide variety of options and materials that can be applied to the session's topic.

One of the best brainstormers I ever attended at IDEO was an exploration of alternative wine beverage containers. Before the brainstormer, we covered a conference table with bottles, closures, materials, and mechanisms ranging from the retro porcelain Grolsch beer bottle stopper to an elegant black Japanese sake flask. By the time we'd examined everything on the table, the session was already in full swing. We had hundreds of ideas before we were done, and a point of view on how to help our client innovate.

7. GET PHYSICAL
Good brainstorms are extremely visual. They include sketching, mind mapping, diagrams, and stick figures. You don't have to be an artist to get your point across with a sketch or diagram. Leave your performance anxieties at the door and jump in with whatever visual tools you have available.

But the best brainstormers often get physical. We move beyond two dimensions and push for three. The first way we do this is to bring in everything but the kitchen sink (and we've brought the sink, too, when it was relevant). That means competitive products, elegant solutions from other fields, and promising technologies that could be applied to the problem. The second way we get physical is to have materials on hand to build crude models of a concept: blocks, foam core, tubing, duct tape, whatever might be useful. The third physical approach is "bodystorming," where we act out current behavior/usage patterns and see how they might be altered. 

THE BRAINSTORMER EFFECT

Hot brainstormers may generate a hundred or more ideas, ten of which may be solid leads. They can help put a team on course, and the rush of adrenaline can keep team members buzzing for days. There's a ripple effect. People talk after brainstormers, sharing wild or practical ideas that may have come out of a particularly vibrant session. A great brainstormer gives you a fantastic feeling of possibility, and an hour later you walk out of the room a little richer for the experience. I think that sense of spontaneous team combustion is why we've been able to find so many unusual solutions to seemingly intractable problems. For example, in designing the slim Dynabook laptop we discovered there wasn't enough room for traditional fasteners. A brainstormer generated the idea of "knitting" the two halves togetherólike a piano hingeówhich sent us out looking for a strong, thin rod threaded on one end. We eventually reached a solution by getting our favorite Palo Alto bike shop to supply custom spokes to Dynabook that, amazingly enough, did the trick.

You can't quantify the value of letting people's minds run wild. At one brainstormer a few designers and engineers got the idea to motorize a swirling pencilóand made one on the spot. "We've struck gold!" somebody yelled out. We didn't follow up successfully on the whimsical toy. But a few years later, with or without our help, the Wigglewriter came to market and sold like hotcakes. A waste of time? Not in my book. It's the sort of incorrigible spirit of play that keeps team members in tune and on edge.

I'm convinced that if you participate regularly in brainstormers, it's like stretching exercises for your mind. You approach problems differently than when you're at your desk or strolling the halls. When a client rejects a course of action, the two or three team members working on that specific aspect of the project don't slink off to their desks to mope. They'll put up chairs to the nearest table and hold a mini-brainstormer, maybe just fifteen or thirty minutes to find a new track.

Brainstormers can do something else for your group. They offer the team members a chance to shine. It's friendly competition. Who doesn't want to demonstrate their cleverness and wittiness in front of their peers? And when a brainstormer thunders, it's a multiple win, a rising tide that lifts everyone up on a wave of excitement.

Some people, of course, are better at brainstorming than others. And truth be told, your performance does matter. Pipe up in brainstormers, bang out a quick prototype, or solve a tricky technical ques-tion, and you'll rise in the eyes of your peers. If you've got an open style of innovationówith brainstormers, prototyping, and problem solvingóyou'll naturally favor those who take action. It's true, "hot groups" aren't a place for shrinking violets. When a newcomer starts peppering a brainstormer with cool ideas, we take notice. You earn respect and authority in that week's brainstormer or on today's prototype team.

Unfortunately, we all occasionally fall victim to negativity. The coach who hammers too hard on the fumbling player, the teacher who corrects the flub and fails to praise the insight. Without a comfort zone, people don't take chances. If you're going to do a lot of brainstorming, there are several other pitfalls to watch out for.

SIX  WAYS  TO KILL A  BRAINSTORMER

A brainstormer is a terrible thing to waste.  Here are six surefire ways to kill a brainstormer.

1. THE BOSS GETS TO SPEAK FIRST
If the boss gets first crack, then he's going to set the agenda and the boundaries, and your brainstormer is immediately limited. I know one Silicon Valley boss who eagerly launched a brainstorm saying he was looking for some great new ideas. But unfortunately, he followed that enthusiasm with a room-silencing caveat: "Oh, and every new idea has to be patentable. And something we can manufacture." In that setting, nobody is going to suggest anything even remotely "wild." Try sending the boss out for coffee. Or doughnuts.

2. EVERYBODY GETS A TURN
I once sat in on a meeting a client thought was brainstorming. Sixteen people were packed into the room. We went clockwise around the table, and each person was given two minutes to speak. It was demo-cratic. It was painful. It was pointless. It definitely wasn't a brainstormer.

3. EXPERTS ONLY PLEASE
Let's see, do I have a materials expert, an engineer, a software guru, and the V.P. of marketing? In brainstorming, don't be an "expert" snob. Bring in someone from manufacturing, who knows how to build things. Invite a customer service rep with lots of field experience. Find someone who reads a lot of science fiction. They may not have the "right" degrees, but they just might have the insight you need.

4. DO IT OFF-SITE
Brainstorming at ski lodges and beach resorts can be counterproductive. Do you want your team members to think that creativity and inspiration only happen at high altitude or within walking distance of an ocean? Don't get me wrong: Off-sites are fine. But remember, you want the buzz of creativity to blow through your offices as regularly as a breeze at the beach.

5. NO SILLY STUFF
Sports utility shopping carts. Velcro diapers. A privacy curtain to hide those embarrassing purchases. These are just a few of the wacky ideas hatched during our Nightline shopping cart brainstormer. I can't emphasize enough what these flights of fancy do for the team. They remind everybody that this isn't like work, that anything goes, and that we're going to have a lot of fun while we solve our problems.

6. WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING
I recently encountered a senior manager who's very good at a lot of things, but very bad at brainstorming. What's his main fault? He writes everything down, and I mean everything. He seldom contributes any-thing useful. Taking notes shifts your focus to the wrong side of your brain. It's like trying to dance and type on your laptop at the same time. Sketch all you want, doodle to your heart's delight. But don't act as if you're in History 101.

Ö.A brainstorm can feel like it's just another meeting, or it can be a fun, invigorating experience that can take a project or a team to a new level.

Thinking
by Tim Brown

THOMAS EDISON created the electric light-
bulb and then wrapped an entire indus-
try around it. The lightbulb is most often
thought of as his signature invention, but
Edison understood that the bulb was little more
than a parlor trick without a system of electric power
generation and transmission to make it truly useful.
So he created that, too.
Thus Edisonís genius lay in his ability to conceive
of a fully developed marketplace, not simply a dis-
crete device. He was able to envision how people
would want to use what he made, and he engineered
toward that insight. He wasnít always prescient (he
originally believed the phonograph would be used mainly
as a business machine for recording and replaying dictation),
but he invariably gave great consideration to usersí needs and
preferences.
Edisonís approach was an early example of what is now
called ìdesign thinkingî ñ a methodology that imbues the
full spectrum of innovation activities with a human-centered
design ethos. By this I mean that innovation is powered by a
thorough understanding, through direct observation, of what
people want and need in their lives and what they like or dis-
like about the way particular products are made, packaged,
marketed, sold, and supported.
Many people believe that Edisonís greatest invention was
the modern R&D laboratory and methods of experimental
investigation. Edison wasnít a narrowly specialized scientist
but a broad generalist with a shrewd
business sense. In his Menlo Park, New
Jersey, laboratory he surrounded himself
with gifted tinkerers, improvisers, and
experimenters. Indeed, he broke the
mold of the ìlone genius inventorî by
creating a team-based approach to in-
novation. Although Edison biographers
write of the camaraderie enjoyed by this
merry band, the process also featured
endless rounds of trial and error ñ the
ì99% perspirationî in Edisonís famous
definition of genius. His approach was
intended not to validate preconceived hypotheses but to help
experimenters learn something new from each iterative stab.
Innovation is hard work; Edison made it a profession that
blended art, craft, science, business savvy, and an astute under-
standing of customers and markets.
Design thinking is a lineal descendant of that tradition. Put
simply, it is a discipline that uses the designerís sensibility and
methods to match peopleís needs with what is technologically
feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into cus-
tomer value and market opportunity. Like Edisonís painstaking
innovation process, it often entails a great deal of perspiration.
I believe that design thinking has much to offer a business
world in which most management ideas and best practices are
freely available to be copied and exploited. Leaders now look
to innovation as a principal source of differentiation and com-
petitive advantage; they would do well to incorporate design
thinking into all phases of the process.

Getting Beneath the Surface
Historically, design has been treated as a downstream step in
the development process ñ the point where designers, who
have played no earlier role in the substantive work of in-
novation, come along and put a beautiful wrapper around
the idea. To be sure, this approach has stimulated market
growth in many areas by making new products and technolo-
gies aesthetically attractive and therefore more desirable to
consumers or by enhancing brand perception through smart,
evocative advertising and communication strategies. Dur-
ing the latter half of the twentieth century design became
an increasingly valuable competitive asset in, for example,
the consumer electronics, automotive, and consumer pack-
aged goods industries. But in most others it remained a late-
stage add-on.
Now, however, rather than asking designers to make an
already developed idea more attractive to consumers, compa-
nies are asking them to create ideas that better meet consum-
ersí needs and desires. The former role is tactical, and results
in limited value creation; the latter is strategic, and leads to
dramatic new forms of value.
Moreover, as economies in the developed world shift from
industrial manufacturing to knowl-
edge work and service delivery, inno-
vationís terrain is expanding. Its ob-
jectives are no longer just physical
products; they are new sorts of pro-
cesses, services, IT-powered interac-
tions, entertainments, and ways of
communicating and collaborating ñ
exactly the kinds of human-centered
activities in which design thinking
can make a decisive difference. (See
the sidebar ìA Design Thinkerís Per-
sonality Profi le.î)
Consider the large health care provider Kaiser Permanente,
which sought to improve the overall quality of both patientsí
and medical practitionersí experiences. Businesses in the ser-
vice sector can often make signifi cant innovations on the front
lines of service creation and delivery. By teaching design think-
ing techniques to nurses, doctors, and administrators, Kaiser
hoped to inspire its practitioners to contribute new ideas.
Over the course of several months Kaiser teams participated
in workshops with the help of my fi rm, IDEO, and a group of
Kaiser coaches. These workshops led to a portfolio of innova-
tions, many of which are being rolled out across the company.
One of them ñ a project to reengineer nursing-staff shift
changes at four Kaiser hospitals ñ perfectly illustrates both the
broader nature of innovation ìproductsî and the value of a holis-
tic design approach. The core project team included a strategist
(formerly a nurse), an organizational-development specialist,
a technology expert, a process designer, a union representative,
and designers from IDEO. This group worked with innovation
teams of frontline practitioners in each of the four hospitals.
During the earliest phase of the project, the core team col-
laborated with nurses to identify a number of problems in the
way shift changes occurred. Chief among these was the fact
that nurses routinely spent the fi rst 45 minutes of each shift at
the nursesí station debriefi ng the departing shift about the sta-
tus of patients. Their methods of information exchange were
different in every hospital, ranging from recorded dictation to
face-to-face conversations. And they compiled the information
they needed to serve patients in a variety of ways ñ scrawling
quick notes on the back of any available scrap of paper, for
example, or even on their scrubs. Despite a signifi cant invest-
ment of time, the nurses often failed to learn some of the
things that mattered most to patients, such as how they had
fared during the previous shift, which family members were
with them, and whether or not certain tests or therapies had
been administered. For many patients, the team learned, each
shift change felt like a hole in their care. Using the insights
gleaned from observing these important times of transition,
the innovation teams explored potential solutions through
brainstorming and rapid prototyping. (Prototypes of a service
innovation will of course not be physical, but they must be
tangible. Because pictures help us understand what is learned
through prototyping, we often videotape the performance of
prototyped services, as we did at Kaiser.)
Prototyping doesnít have to be complex and expensive. In
another health care project, IDEO helped a group of surgeons
develop a new device for sinus surgery. As the surgeons de-
scribed the ideal physical characteristics of the instrument,
one of the designers grabbed a whiteboard marker, a fi lm
canister, and a clothespin and taped them together. ìDo you
mean like this?î he asked. With his rudimentary prototype in
hand, the surgeons were able to be much more precise about
what the ultimate design should accomplish.
Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and
investment as are needed to generate useful feedback and
evolve an idea. The more ìfi nishedî a prototype seems, the less
likely its creators will be to pay attention to and profi t from
feedback. The goal of prototyping isnít to fi nish. It is to learn
about the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and to identify
new directions that further prototypes might take.
The design that emerged for shift changes had nurses pass-
ing on information in front of the patient rather than at the
nursesí station. In only a week the team built a working pro-
totype that included new procedures and some simple soft-
ware with which nurses could call up previous shift-change
notes and add new ones. They could input patient informa-
tion throughout a shift rather than scrambling at the end to
pass it on. The software collated the data in a simple format
customized for each nurse at the start of a shift. The result
was both higher-quality knowledge transfer and reduced prep
time, permitting much earlier and better-informed contact
with patients.
As Kaiser measured the impact of this change over time, it
learned that the mean interval between a nurseís arrival and
fi rst interaction with a patient had been more than halved,
adding a huge amount of nursing time across the four hospi-
tals. Perhaps just as important was the effect on the quality
of the nursesí work experience. One nurse commented, ìIím
an hour ahead, and Iíve only been here 45 minutes.î Another
said, ì[This is the] fi rst time Iíve ever made it out of here at
the end of my shift.î
Thus did a group of nurses signifi cantly improve their pa-
tientsí experience while also improving their own job satis-
faction and productivity. By applying a human-centered
design methodology, they were able to create a rela-
tively small process innovation that produced an
outsize impact. The new shift changes are being
rolled out across the Kaiser system, and the ca-
pacity to reliably record critical patient infor-
mation is being integrated into an electronic
medical records initiative at the company.
What might happen at Kaiser if every
nurse, doctor, and administrator in every
hospital felt empowered to tackle problems
the way this group did? To fi nd out, Kaiser
has created the Garfi eld Innovation Center,
which is run by Kaiserís original core team
and acts as a consultancy to the entire or-
ganization. The centerís mission is to pur-
sue innovation that enhances the patient
experience and, more broadly, to envision
Kaiserís ìhospital of the future.î It is intro-
ducing tools for design thinking across the
Kaiser system.

How Design Thinking Happens
The myth of creative genius is resilient:
We believe that great ideas pop fully
formed out of brilliant minds, in feats of
imagination well beyond the abilities of
mere mortals. But what the Kaiser nursing
team accomplished was neither a sudden
breakthrough nor the lightning strike of
genius; it was the result of hard work aug-
mented by a creative human-centered discov-
ery process and followed by iterative cycles of
prototyping, testing, and refi nement.
The design process is best described meta-
phorically as a system of spaces rather than a pre-
defi ned series of orderly steps. The spaces demar-
cate different sorts of related activities that together
form the continuum of innovation. Design thinking
can feel chaotic to those experiencing it for the fi rst
time. But over the life of a project participants come to
see ñ as they did at Kaiser ñ that the process makes sense
and achieves results, even though its architecture differs
from the linear, milestone-based processes typical of other
kinds of business activities.
Design projects must ultimately pass through three spaces
(see the exhibit at right). We label these ìinspiration,î for the
circumstances (be they a problem, an opportunity, or both)
that motivate the search for solutions; ìideation,î for the
process of generating, developing, and testing ideas that may
lead to solutions; and ìimplementation,î for the charting of a
path to market. Projects will loop back through these spaces ñ
particularly the fi rst two ñ more than once as ideas are refi ned
and new directions taken.
Sometimes the trigger for a project is leadershipís recogni-
tion of a serious change in business fortunes. In 2004 Shimano,
a Japanese manufacturer of bicycle components, faced fl at-
tening growth in its traditional high-end road-racing and
mountain-bike segments in the United States. The com-
pany had always relied on technology innovations
to drive its growth and naturally tried to predict
where the next one might come from. This time
Shimano thought a high-end casual bike that ap-
pealed to boomers would be an interesting area
to explore. IDEO was invited to collaborate on
the project.
During the inspiration phase, an inter-
disciplinary team of IDEO and Shimano
people ñ designers, behavioral scientists,
marketers, and engineers ñ worked to
identify appropriate constraints for the
project. The team began with a hunch
that it should focus more broadly than
on the high-end market, which might
prove to be neither the only nor even
the best source of new growth. So it
set out to learn why 90% of American
adults donít ride bikes. Looking for new
ways to think about the problem, the
team members spent time with all kinds
of consumers. They discovered that nearly
everyone they met rode a bike as a child
and had happy memories of doing so. They
also discovered that many Americans are
intimidated by cycling today ñ by the retail
experience (including the young, Lycra-clad ath-
letes who serve as sales staff in most independent
bike stores); by the complexity and cost of the bikes,
accessories, and specialized clothing; by the danger
of cycling on roads not designed for bicycles; and by
the demands of maintaining a technically sophisticated
bike that is ridden infrequently.
This human-centered exploration ñ which took its insights
from people outside Shimanoís core customer base ñ led to
the realization that a whole new category of bicycling might
be able to reconnect American consumers to their experi-
ences as children while also dealing with the root causes of
their feelings of intimidation ñ thus revealing a large un-
tapped market.
The design team, responsible for every aspect of what was
envisioned as a holistic experience, came up with the concept
of ìCoasting.î Coasting would aim to entice lapsed bikers into
an activity that was simple, straight-
forward, and fun. Coasting bikes, built
more for pleasure than for sport, would
have no controls on the handlebars, no
cables snaking along the frame. As on
the earliest bikes many of us rode, the brakes would be applied
by backpedaling. With the help of an onboard computer, a
minimalist three gears would shift automatically as the bicy-
cle gained speed or slowed. The bikes would feature comfort-
ably padded seats, be easy to operate, and require relatively
little maintenance.
Three major manufacturers ñ Trek, Raleigh, and Giant ñ de-
veloped new bikes incorporating innovative components from
Shimano. But the design team didnít stop with the bike itself.
In-store retailing strategies were created for independent bike
dealers, in part to alleviate the discomfort that biking novices
felt in stores designed to serve enthusiasts. The team devel-
oped a brand that identifi ed Coasting as a way to enjoy life.
(ìChill. Explore. Dawdle. Lollygag. First one thereís a rotten
egg.î) And it designed a public relations campaign ñ in collabo-
ration with local governments and cycling organizations ñ that
identifi ed safe places to ride.
Although many others became involved in the project
when it reached the implementation phase, the application
of design thinking in the earliest stages of innovation is what
led to this complete solution. Indeed, the single thing one
would have expected the design team
to be responsible for ñ the look of the
bikes ñ was intentionally deferred to
later in the development process, when
the team created a reference design to
inspire the bike companiesí own design teams. After a success-
ful launch in 2007, seven more bicycle manufacturers signed
up to produce Coasting bikes in 2008.

Taking a Systems View
Many of the worldís most successful brands create break-
through ideas that are inspired by a deep understanding of
consumersí lives and use the principles of design to innovate
and build value. Sometimes innovation has to account for
vast differences in cultural and socioeconomic conditions. In
such cases design thinking can suggest creative alternatives
to the assumptions made in developed societies.
Indiaís Aravind Eye Care System is probably the worldís
largest provider of eye care. From April 2006 to March 2007
Aravind served more than 2.3 million patients and performed
more than 270,000 surgeries. Founded in 1976 by Dr. G. Venka-
taswamy, Aravind has as its mission nothing less than the erad-
ication of needless blindness among Indiaís population, includ-
ing the rural poor, through the effective delivery of superior
ophthalmic care. (One of the companyís slogans is ìQuality is
for everyone.î) From 11 beds in Dr. Venkataswamyís home,
Aravind has grown to encompass fi ve hos-
pitals (three others are under Aravind
management), a plant that manufac-
tures ophthalmic products, a research
foundation, and a training center.
Aravindís execution of its mission and
model is in some respects reminiscent of Edisonís holistic con-
cept of electric power delivery. The challenge the company
faces is logistic: how best to deliver eye care to populations far
removed from the urban centers where Aravindís hospitals are
located. Aravind calls itself an ìeye care systemî for a reason:
Its business goes beyond ophthalmic care per se to transmit
expert practice to populations that have historically lacked ac-
cess. The company saw its network of hospitals as a beginning
rather than an end.
Much of its innovative energy has focused on bringing both
preventive care and diagnostic screening to the countryside.
Since 1990 Aravind has held ìeye campsî in Indiaís rural ar-
eas, in an effort to register patients, administer eye exams,
teach eye care, and identify people who may require surgery
or advanced diagnostic services or who have conditions that
warrant monitoring.
In 2006 and early 2007 Aravind eye camps screened more
than 500,000 patients, of whom nearly 113,000 required surgery.
Access to transportation is a common problem in rural areas, so
the company provides buses that take patients needing further
treatment to one of its urban facilities
and then home again. Over the years it
has bolstered its diagnostic capabilities
in the fi eld with telemedicine trucks,
which enable doctors back at Aravindís
hospitals to participate in care decisions.
In recent years Aravindís analysis of its screening data has led
to specialized eye camps for certain demographic groups, such
as school-age children and industrial and government workers;
the company also holds camps specifi cally to screen for eye
diseases associated with diabetes. All these services are free for
the roughly 60% of patients who cannot afford to pay.
In developing its system of care, Aravind has consistently
exhibited many characteristics of design thinking. It has used
as a creative springboard two constraints: the poverty and
remoteness of its clientele and its own lack of access to expen-
sive solutions. For example, a pair of intraocular lenses made
in the West costs $200, which severely limited the number of
patients Aravind could help. Rather than try to persuade sup-
pliers to change the way they did things, Aravind built its own
solution: a manufacturing plant in the basement of one of its
hospitals. It eventually discovered that it could use relatively
inexpensive technology to produce lenses for $4 a pair.
Throughout its history ñ defi ned by the constraints of poverty,
ignorance, and an enormous unmet need ñ Aravind has built
a systemic solution to a complex social and medical problem.

Getting Back to the Surface
I argued earlier that design thinking can lead to innovation
that goes beyond aesthetics, but that doesnít mean that form
and aesthetics are unimportant. Magazines like to publish
photographs of the newest, coolest products for a reason: They
are sexy and appeal to our emotions. Great design satisfi es
both our needs and our desires. Often the emotional connec-
tion to a product or an image is what engages us in the fi rst
place. Time and again we see successful products that were
not necessarily the fi rst to market but were the fi rst to appeal
to us emotionally and functionally. In other words, they do
the job and we love them. The iPod was not the fi rst MP3
player, but it was the fi rst to be delightful. Targetís products
appeal emotionally through design and functionally through
price ñ simultaneously.
This idea will grow ever more important in the future. As
Daniel Pink writes in his book A Whole New Mind, ìAbundance
has satisfi ed, and even over-satisfi ed, the material needs of
millions ñ boosting the signifi cance of beauty and emotion
and accelerating individualsí search for meaning.î As more of
our basic needs are met, we increasingly expect sophisticated
experiences that are emotionally satisfying and meaningful.
These experiences will not be simple products. They will be
complex combinations of products, services, spaces, and infor-
mation. They will be the ways we get educated, the ways we
are entertained, the ways we stay healthy, the ways we share
and communicate. Design thinking is a tool for imagining
these experiences as well as giving them a desirable form.
One example of experiential innovation comes from a fi nan-
cial services company. In late 2005 Bank of America launched
a new savings account service called ìKeep the Change.î IDEO,
working with a team from the bank, helped iden-
tify a consumer behavior that many people will
recognize: After paying cash for something, we put
the coins we received in change into a jar at home.
Once the jar is full, we take the coins to the bank
and deposit them in a savings account. For many
people, itís an easy way of saving. Bank of Americaís
innovation was to build this behavior into a debit
card account. Customers who use their debit cards
to make purchases can now choose to have the total
rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference
deposited in their savings accounts.
The success of this innovation lay in its appeal to
an instinctive desire we have to put money aside in a
painless and invisible way. Keep the Change creates
an experience that feels natural because it models
behavior that many of us already exhibit. To be sure,
Bank of America sweetens the deal by matching
100% of the change saved in the fi rst three months
and 5% of annual totals (up to $250) thereafter. This
encourages customers to try it out. But the real pay-
off is emotional: the gratifi cation that comes with
monthly statements showing customers theyíve saved money
without even trying.
In less than a year the program attracted 2.5 million custom-
ers. It is credited with 700,000 new checking accounts and a
million new savings accounts. Enrollment now totals more than
5 million people who together have saved more than $500 mil-
lion. Keep the Change demonstrates that design thinking can
identify an aspect of human behavior and then convert it into
both a customer benefi t and a business value.
Thomas Edison represents what many of us think of as a
golden age of American innovation ñ a time when new ideas
transformed every aspect of our lives. The need for transfor-
mation is, if anything, greater now than ever before. No mat-
ter where we look, we see problems that can be solved only
through innovation: unaffordable or unavailable health care,
billions of people trying to live on just a few dollars a day,
energy usage that outpaces the planetís ability to support it,
education systems that fail many students, companies whose
traditional markets are disrupted by new technologies or de-
mographic shifts. These problems all have people at their heart.
They require a human-centered, creative, iterative, and practi-
cal approach to fi nding the best ideas and ultimate solutions.
Design thinking is just such an approach to innovation.
